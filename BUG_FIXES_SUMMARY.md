# Bug Fixes: File Viewing and Name Editing Issues

## 🐛 Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Marketplace "View" Button Not Loading Files
**Problem**: When clicking "View" on marketplace items, uploaded 3D files weren't loading in the viewer.

**Root Causes**:
1. Blob URLs have limited lifetime and can become invalid
2. File data wasn't being persisted properly in localStorage
3. No fallback mechanism for accessing file data

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Dual Storage System**: Files now stored as both blob URLs (for immediate use) and base64 data (for persistence)
2. **Enhanced File Upload**: Added base64 conversion during file upload process
3. **Smart File Loading**: View function tries blob URL first, falls back to base64 if needed
4. **Comprehensive Debugging**: Added console logs to track file storage and loading process

### Issue 2: Design Name Not Editable in Listing Process  
**Problem**: The design name field in the sell modal was being overridden and couldn't be edited.

**Root Cause**: 
- `useEffect` was continuously resetting the design name whenever `uploadedFile` changed
- No protection against overwriting user edits

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Conditional Initialization**: Only auto-populate design name when modal first opens (`show` prop changes)
- **Preserved User Input**: No longer overwrites user edits to the design name
- **Smart Auto-Population**: Still provides helpful default names from filename

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Enhanced File Storage Architecture
```typescript
// During Upload
const fileURL = URL.createObjectURL(file); // Blob URL for immediate use
const reader = new FileReader();
reader.onload = (event) => {
  const base64Data = event.target?.result as string; // Base64 for persistence
  // Store both in uploadedFiles
};

// During Design Creation  
const designData = {
  // ... other properties
  fileURL: currentFile?.fileURL,     // Blob URL
  fileBase64: currentFile?.fileBase64, // Base64 data
  fileType: currentFile?.fileType
};

// During Viewing
if (item.fileURL) {
  // Try blob URL first
  const response = await fetch(item.fileURL);
  const blob = await response.blob();
  file = new File([blob], item.name, { type: blob.type });
} else if (item.fileBase64) {
  // Fallback to base64
  const response = await fetch(item.fileBase64);
  const blob = await response.blob();  
  file = new File([blob], item.name, { type: blob.type });
}
```

### Fixed Modal Behavior
```typescript
// Before: Overwrote user input
useEffect(() => {
  if (uploadedFile && uploadedFile.name) {
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, designName: cleanName }));
  }
}, [uploadedFile]); // Triggered on every change

// After: Only initializes, preserves edits
useEffect(() => {
  if (show && uploadedFile && uploadedFile.name) {
    setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, designName: cleanName }));
  }
}, [show, uploadedFile]); // Only when modal opens
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test File Viewing Fix:
1. **Upload a 3D file** (STL, OBJ, etc.) using the upload button
2. **Create a design listing** by clicking "Sell Design" 
3. **Fill out the form** and submit (name should now be editable!)
4. **Go to Store/Marketplace** and find your design
5. **Click "View"** - your 3D file should now load properly
6. **Check browser console** for debugging info about file loading process

### Test Name Editing Fix:
1. **Upload a file** - note the auto-generated design name
2. **Click "Sell Design"** - modal opens with auto-populated name  
3. **Edit the design name** - should be fully editable now
4. **Type new characters** - should not be overridden
5. **Submit the form** - should save with your edited name

### Debug Information Available:
- File upload process: Check console for blob URL creation and base64 conversion
- Design creation: See what data is being saved to localStorage
- Store loading: View what designs are loaded and their file data
- File viewing: Track blob URL vs base64 loading attempts

## 🎯 Expected Results

### ✅ What Should Work Now:
- **File Viewing**: All user-uploaded designs should load properly when clicking "View"
- **Name Editing**: Design name field is fully editable in the sell modal
- **Persistence**: File data persists across browser sessions using base64 storage
- **Fallback System**: If blob URLs fail, base64 data provides backup access
- **Better UX**: Clear status messages about loading progress and any issues

### 🔍 If Issues Persist:
1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages during file upload/viewing
2. **Verify File Size**: Very large files might timeout during base64 conversion  
3. **Check Storage**: Open DevTools > Application > Local Storage to see saved data
4. **Test File Types**: Some 3D file formats might need specific handling

## 📊 Storage Details

### File Data Flow:
```
Upload File → Create Blob URL + Base64 → 
Store in uploadedFiles → Save to Design Database → 
Load in Marketplace → View with Fallback System
```

### localStorage Structure:
- `curfd_designs`: Array of design objects with file data
- Each design includes: `fileURL`, `fileBase64`, `fileName`, `fileType`
- Base64 data provides persistence across browser sessions
- Blob URLs provide efficient immediate access

Both issues should now be resolved with comprehensive debugging to help identify any remaining problems!
